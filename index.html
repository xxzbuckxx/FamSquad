                            Uhhhhhhhh... I expect to you begin quoting me right now and all the gibberish i start saying (end Zack typing). (Begin Thuy-An typing for Gib) So, we had a pretty great day, so first we woke up and we had some pretty dank italian breakfast. we had some pretty dank italian eggs and some pretty dank italian toast which is like normal toast except the crust is significantly harder to eat. We then took the car down to the ferry. UMM... then we rode on the ferry for like an hour. At first, we were idiots and sat in the back where there was no wind and smelled like exhaust. We then moved to the front where there was a nice breeze and we didnt smell the stinky cheese (in our bag). Oh yeah, before we got on the ferry, we stopped to get bread, prosciutto, and smelly cheese so we can have some sandwiches for lunch. After the ferry ride, we got off the check out the villa and found out that it was not open on Wednesdays. Then, we walked over to it anyways because there was a nice swimming spot near it and some benches to have our lunch. (Ellie begins typing again for Gib because Thuy is tired.) We then walked up the path to reaffirm that the villa was indeed closed. So then we decided to have lunch at the nice table at the top of the hill that had a good view of the lake. Lunch was very yummy and there was a nice breeze so the stinky cheese wasn't thaaat stinki. Then after our yummy lunch we walked down to the beach but we totally went the wrong way but we found this paid beach where they had nice chairs and umbrellas but had replaced the nice lake rocks with awful sand (anakin skywalker cough cough).
                            We chilled and swam there for a bit, and there was this nice boat dock that was a little bit of a swim out but it was nice to swim there and the water was very cool. After spending the afternoon lounging in the sun and swimming in the cool lake, whatever it's name is, we then decided to walk back to the ferry. On our way back to the ferry, we stopped and had delicious gelato at this nice little shop where they had this cool revolving fridge at -20.0 degrees (celcius) that was full of frozen ice bars. We all got delicious gelato but I personally was annoyed because they just put it all at the top but didn't shmoosh it down into the cone like you're supposed to, but anyway. After enjoying our gelato, we boarded the ferry once again, except this time there was no breeze so we all just sat there and sweat like pigs. 'Cept Mom, because she had the sense to go and stand at the top of the boat where there was breeze. After we got back from the ferry ride (where my tomogachi evolved to a teenager) we were all grumpy and hungry, so we decided to go around the bend and get some Pizzzzah. We sat at this nice little cafe that was covered and had vines growing all along the walls of the patio and due to these vines that were very pretty there were like eighty fucking birds that just kept tweeting and flying in our faces. Other than that the meal was great. 
                            I had a delightful pasta with bacon, Zack had a pretty dank proscuitto pizza, some other people got some other stuff, Thuy-an had a virgin mojito that I tried and it was pretty nice. Thuy-an says it was really fricking good but I just thought it was pretty nice. After the meal we decided to get more gelato, and I made the horrible mistake thinking that shakes in Italy are the same in the U.S so I got to drink a cup of liquid ice cream. It was pretty good liquid ice cream but I wanted a shake, and that it was not. We then continued our walk home and decided to stop and the same grocery store that we got our stinky cheese and dank Italian eggs to get some more dank Italian eggs but no more stinky cheese because we are done with the stinky cheese. No more stink for us thank you. While everyone was checking out the groceries I had a gurgle in my tummy and realized that if I did not find a bathroom within the next three minutes I was violently poop myself (Gib is lactose intolerant). I ran next door, was told that the bathroom was customers only, and bought a pack of oreos, oh by the way zack do you want some oreos? I really want to get more graphic but grandma is gonna read this. Don't include that. After coming back to the group and finding mom missing, because she went to get the car and come back to us, we then waited in the sun for eight minutes. After wondering where mom was, we walked up the street a little into the shade, and Ellie volunteered to find what was taking her so long. 
                            After like five minutes, Ellie came back and told us that Mom was just waiting at the top of the hill and we were waiting at the bottom because everyone is dumb and doesn't know how to communicate. We then all piled in the car and mom drove like a true crazy Italian person super fast up the side of the mountain. I don't know what else to say. And that's kind of the end of our day. I don't know how to end this, can I end it like this? *snaps*

                            It's been an amazing third day in Switzerland. Today we were in MÃ¼rren hiking up on the mountains. We took the cable car to Birg (at an altitude of 2600 meters) and hiked around the mountain top. After a nice lunch/snack at a ski-chalet restaurant Gib, Thuy-an, and Zack walked back to the Cable Car station while Ellie and Mom continued on to the lake on the other side. They returned to the hotel by hiking all the way down the mountain! The final fit-bit total was 91 floors walked.

                            We are all leaving today for Switzerland! Gib is really stressed about packing up all of his electronics and Momma just came home from a concert last night. We all have our bags packed in order and ready to go. Everyone is running around and doing last minute things! We are all so excited to be in Switzerland soon! Hope to update you guys soon!

                            With T-4 days till we leave for Switzerland Thuy-an is preparing herself by <i>"just chilling"</i> on her laptop. Gib, on the other hand, is driving all the way to his apartment in Milwaukee to get his hiking shoes which Zack and Thuy-an also just remembered they still need to get.
